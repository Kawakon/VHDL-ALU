# Four Operation Arithmetic Logic Unit using VHDL

In this project, a four operation arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is design in VHDL. The operations that can 
be performed by the ALU are addition, logic OR, multiplication, and division. The ALU performs these operations
on 8-bit operands and the results are printed onto a seven-segment LED display in hexadecimal. The 8-bit binary
result is also displayed by a sequence of LEDs. A diagram of the ALU can be seen below:
